# Brease_cancer_classification

The primary goal of this project is to explore, compare, and implement different machine learning classification algorithms to build an effective classification predictive model to distinguish benign and malignnat using publicly available Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset.

Here, I have implemented Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn to clean, visualize and model clinical data of breast cancer dataset. Moreoverm I have enhanced modelâ€™s performance by hyperparameter tuning and achieved ~98.25% accuracy (with logistiic regression) on testing data.
